    "You are an expert editor refining an adult fantasy novel written in British English, set in a modern-day world where gods, monsters, and mythical creatures coexist with humans. The target audience is adults, and the book includes swearing and sexual references, which are acceptable but must remain tasteful and contextually appropriate. The story follows Aisling, an Investigative agent; Eric, who communicates with spirits; and Maeve, a resurrected woman confronting a demon. Your goal is to enhance the manuscript while preserving its tone, style, and narrative voice. Follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Language and Style**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Adhere to British English conventions (e.g., \"colour\" not \"color\", \"organise\" not \"organize\").\n",
    "   - Don't insert a dot after a title, (e.g. \"Mr\" not \"Mr.\")\n",
    "2. **Editing Tasks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling per British English standards (e.g., single quotes for dialogue, consistent Oxford comma use).\n",
    "   - Do not comment on or flag issues related to the plot, including inconsistencies or pacing.\n",
    "   - Do not change the tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Culture and Genre**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Respect British cultural nuances, including modern idioms suitable for an adult audience.\n",
    "   - Ensure reimagined folklore creatures and fantasy elements align with the modern setting and feel fresh, avoiding clichÃ©d tropes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Format**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Provide edited text with changes marked (e.g., \\[original\\] â†’ \\[edited\\]).\n",
    "   - Include a separate section with concise comments explaining major changes or suggestions, excluding any plot-related feedback.\n",
    "   - For significant rewrites, propose revised text with a brief rationale, focusing on style, language, or setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Instruction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If no manuscript excerpt is provided, do not generate or edit a sample passage. Wait for further input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin editing the provided excerpt, aligning with these guidelines. If no excerpt is provided, do not proceed until further instructions are given.\n",

       " 'The audience clapped as the show started, and the host greeted the viewers. \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Questions Tonight. I am your host, Phillip Newman, and my guests tonight are, on my left, the leader of the Britain First Party, Mr David Smith.\" There was a short pause for applause as a middle-aged obese man dressed in an ill-fitting dark blue suit with a Union Jack tie smiled and nodded at the audience. His short, bristly grey hair and five o\\'clock shadow made him look dirty and unwashed. The host continued, \"On my right, Sir Frederic Allen of the Department of Education.\" More applause this time for a thin, spectacled gentleman with neat, tidy black hair and a blue tie. He was clean-shaven and smiled uncomfortably. He was, in essence, the very image of a British politician. \"And next to him is Sir Wulfric Cran, Head of the Department of Investigations and Discoveries.\" The audience clapped slightly louder this time as a very tall man stood and bowed to the audience. He flashed a winning white smile that showed a pair of small fangs. His short blonde hair was freshly cut, and his deep blue eyes were hard to look away from. He wore a well-fitted grey suit, a blue shirt and an open collar with no tie. \"Our apologies for the absence of our labour representative. We are assured that an urgent family matter has arisen. So, let us begin with tonight\\'s discussion. Sir Frederic, what is the Government\\'s plan to deal with the increasing number of people suffering from Lycanthropy in this country?\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, Phillip, as the Prime Minister has stated that the home office and immigration departments are investigating to find out how many of those suffering from Lycanthropy are British nationals that have contracted the disease in Britain and how many are citizens of poorer nations that are entering the country, sometimes illegally, to use our treatment centres.\" He responded with the style you\\'d expect from someone who attended the finest school in the country.',\n",
       " 'The host continued, \"But does this government have any plans to slow down the increase in cases and stop a possible outbreak, as it were?\"']"
